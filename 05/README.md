## Epic vs Stories

### Epics

are large bodies of work that can be broken down into a number of smaller tasks 

### Stories

also called `user stories` are short requirements or requests written from the perspective of an end user.

## From `User stories` to `Tasks`

Break down user stories into small tasks that can be individually picked up by team members.

- Keep tasks small
- Estimate each task
- Agree on what `done` means for every task.

Each task translates to a `Trello` card.

`Make sure to regularly update your task tracking tool`

Example User Story - from this [article](https://www.pluralsight.com/guides/break-down-agile-user-stories-into-tasks-and-estimate-level-of-effort)

`As a registered user, I want to log in with my username and password so that the system can authenticate me and I can trust it.`

One way of breaking it down into tasks -

- Design Login Page
- Develop html/css/js for login & validation
- Develop backend api, encrypt password  & query DB
- Define/link user table in database
- Integration test

## Architecture View Models

Simplifies the design by breaking down the entire system into `different` views

Extremely great content in this week's lecture slides

## Coding Standards

Rules & guidelines to follow when writing code

- identify problems before running it
- readable, uniform code
- follows best practices
- uniform coding style

Js/Ts

- code quality - ESLint, Prettier
- commenting - eslint-plugin-jsdoc

`Have a document that presents your coding standards`

## GitHub Release

At the end of each sprint, create a GitHub [release](https://docs.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/releasing-projects-on-github/managing-releases-in-a-repository#creating-a-release) and add it to your submission checklist.

In a way, it marks a specific point in your repository's history

## Team updates

One member from each team will give a brief update on their teams progress

## Breakout rooms
