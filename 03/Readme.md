## Client Meeting

- Establish a basic understanding of the problem
- Identify requirements
- Identify the nature of the solution that is desired

Tips -

- Prepare an agenda and brainstorm on questions to ask.
- Nominate a facilitator and meeting minutes taker, good to verify meeting minutes with the client.
- Presenting a motivation model can be useful, your client probably has experience with it.
- With online meetings, keeping a recording of the important meetings can be useful. Ask your client permission to record.

As a user, I want to cancel my hotel booking at any time, 
so that I do not lose money if travel restrictions change.
