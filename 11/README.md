Agree on a date for the handover meeting, do this soon.

Handover can include -

- Access to Github repository

Remember to add a nice Readme to your repository.
  
Good to keep a private export of docuemnts for future reference

## Presentations next week

- Summarize the list of delivered requirements, unique features, specific requests
- Design, testing, pipelines & deployment.
