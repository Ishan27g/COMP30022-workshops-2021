## Agile

Iterative approach to project management.

- Requirements and plans are evaluated continously 
- Short development cycles, allowing for quicker changes.

**Scrum** describes a set of meetings, roles, tools to facilitate Agile

```txt
• Sprints (3 x 3 weeks approximately)
• Retrospectives (end of each sprint)
• Scope considered dynamically each sprint
• Flexible & Lightweight
```

All features/requirements form the **product backlog**

Each Sprint

- Decide on features for Sprint 1 (Sprint 1 Backlog)
- Development, testing & review during Sprint

Aim to deliver a minimum viable product and then continually improve in the next sprint

## Agile Ceremonies

**Sprint Planning** ~ Beginning of the Sprint

- The product owner prioritizes on the product backlog
- The team discusses about high priority features and breaks them down into smalled tasks (eg. design/fe/be/db/test/docs)
- Estimate the effort required for each task.
- Once tasks & effort is estimated, move tasks to the sprint backlog.
  
Estimation -
Agree of the unit of effort ( for example, points - 1,3,5,7,10 )
For each task, come to an agreement of the effort required to complete it.

**Standups** ~ 15 mins

Provides the whole team a regular snapshot on how the project is running
Not usually the time to resolve conflicts or assign tasks, more about providing an update

Each team member answers -
• What did I complete in the last week?
• What do I plan to work on?
• Am I blocked by anything?

**Each team member must attend**. Email me incase you are unable to attend the standup.

**I expect everyones cameras to be on for standups**

**Sprint Retrospective** ~ End of the Sprint

- Reflect on the completed sprint
- Discuss what went well, what can be improved & any action items
