# COMP30022 Workshop 2

## Tools

What did you think about yesterdays guest lecture?

what tools have you agreed on -

1. Task Management
2. Communication channel
3. Code Repository
4. Documentation

These are a crucial part of your assessments. Make sure to document what tools are used, how the team communicates & what the team processes are.

1 & 2 -> Go through them during weekly standups
3 & 4 -> Send me invites at my student email - igoyal@student.unimelb.edu.au

`Discuss each team's agreed toolset`

## Tech stack

- Frontend
  - worthwile to look into ui component libraries
- Backend
  - or serverless
- Database
- Think about deployment sooner rather than later.
- Your client may have a minor say in your tech stack and deployment, but there will be lots of room for negotiation.
  
`Discuss each team's thoughts about their tech stack`

## Client meeting

- Next lecture is on `Requirements`, it is important to understand what the client meetings are about.
- Contact your client and arrange for a `requirements analysis` meeting, preferably after the lecture.

What I would recommend -

- For the first meeting, prioritise agreeing on the tech stack, deployment platform and application features over the look and feel of it.
- In subsequent meetings, show the client your idea for the UI and negotiate from there.
